# Descendant Combinator Exercise

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of the descendant combinator in CSS. The goal is to apply styles specifically to elements that are descendants of another element, while leaving unrelated elements unstyled. By completing this exercise, you'll gain hands-on experience with combinators and better understand how to target nested elements in your HTML.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and practice the descendant combinator in CSS.
- Learn how to style elements based on their relationship to parent elements.
- Enhance familiarity with combining selectors for precise styling.

## Requirements
For this exercise:
- Only the `p` elements that are descendants of the `div` element should have the following styles:
  - Yellow background
  - Red text
  - Font size of 20px
  - Center-aligned text

## Approach
- Use type or class selectors for the descendant combinator as needed.
- Ensure that only the targeted `p` elements inside the `div` are styled while other `p` elements remain unaffected.
- Experiment with combining type and class selectors if desired for additional practice.

## Outcome
By the end of this exercise, you will:
1. Gain a solid understanding of how the descendant combinator works in CSS.
2. Be able to selectively apply styles to nested elements.
3. Improve your CSS structuring skills for better maintainability.
